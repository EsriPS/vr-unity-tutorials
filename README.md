## About

This repository contains several Unity projects that help people understand how to leverage the ArcGIS Maps SDKs for Game Engines within Unity. You will find a URP project showcasing our VR development work and a HDRP project showcasing Realtime work.

* [Virtual Reality (URP)](https://github.com/EsriPS/xr-realtime-unity-tutorials/tree/main/VR%20Project%20(URP))

## Getting Started

Whether you plan to explore the VR or Realtime aspect of this repository, there are a number of FBX files that need to be placed in the correct location before you launch these Unity projects for the first time.

* Download all of the [FBX models](https://esriis-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jeff8977_esri_com/EvcKTCBgCF5Hjgr4PSjLeUMBTGd7wtKgntu3n3o2qE_WOQ?e=R1IkZR) to your machine and place them in the **/Assets/Resources/Models** directory of your project. 
* Open Unity Hub and start your Unity project as you would normally.
  * If you are opening the VR content, the project starts in the VR Tutorials directory under VR Project (URP).
* Each project will have a Walkthroughs folder with content to help you understand how each Scene was built. Please review these documents and let us know if you find any issues.

## Requirements

Each project will have slightly different requirements, but the core requirement is Unity at version >= 2021.3.181f.
