<!-- README GUIDELINES START

Welcome to your InnerSource project's README! ðŸ‘‹

Throughout this file, there will be guidance (marked with comment tags for easy removal) + boilerplate language to get you started quickly. Consistency across project READMEs will help our InnerSource community grow faster â€“Â but please feel free to modify this file as much as you need.

The first thing in this template is a banner, which should contain an image, tagline, and any badges you'd like to include with your project. 
  - The image is sourced from `documentation/github-banner.png` so you can easily replace that image with one of your own.
  - If you're unsure what badges are, check out https://shields.io/
  - Here are some nice README banner sections to check out: https://github.com/EsriPS/experience-builder-samples, https://github.com/EsriPS/arcgis-assistant

<!-- CONTENTS GUIDELINES START

This section is a simple table of contents to help users navigate your README. GitHub automatically turns your markdown headers into kebab-cased anchor tags, so linking is really simple.

## Contents

- [Contents](#contents)
- [About](#about)
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Core Team](#core-team)

<!-- ABOUT SECTION GUIDELINES START

This should contain a brief (1-3 sentences) description of the mission of your project. The goal is to state what you are planning to work on and help both intended users as well as external contributors understand roughly which types of features will be included in this project.

ABOUT SECTION GUIDELINES END -->
  
## About

ArcGIS offers unique capabilities and flexible licensing for applying location-based analytics to your business practices. Gain greater insights using contextual tools to visualize and analyze your data. Collaborate and share via maps, apps, dashboards and reports.

<!-- GETTING STARTED SECTION GUIDELINES START

This section should contain brief documentation written for first time users on how to get started using the project. If you have more detailed documentation, you should keep this section but just link users to your docs.

GETTING STARTED SECTION GUIDELINES END -->
  
## Getting Started

All you need to do to get started is run the following commands after forking/cloning this repo:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

<!-- CONTRIBUTING SECTION GUIDELINES START

This section should document (or link to documentation) on all things that a first time contributor needs to know to get started. Typically not all of the topics below will be covered. Focus on what differs in your project from standard setup and what previous contributors found hard to understand.

  - Finding the source code.
  - Finding a list of issues that your project needs help with - these can be both, technical and non-technical issues. Typically you will keep those in an issue tracker accessible to contributors.
  - Links to further documentation e.g. about the architecture of the project, general coding conventions, testing conventions...
  - For technical contributions: Making changes, building the project and testing your changes.
  - Submitting your changes back to the project.

Ideally you also include information on what the preferred process for changes looks like for the project: Should contributors first open an issue and submit a proposal, or are they welcome to submit changes right away? What is important to you when reviewing contributions?

In addition you should outline any design values you want to follow in the project. Making those explicit often helps resolve trade-offs more quickly and more easily. In addition it helps making changes to otherwise implicit assumptions transparent.

  Over time you will notice that this section grows substantially. In that case think about moving the information to separate files, e.g. a `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `TESTING.md`.

CONTRIBUTING SECTION GUIDELINES END -->
  
## Contributing

We welcome pull requests from anyone! If you're interested in contributing to this project, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
  
<!-- CORE TEAM SECTION GUIDELINES START

Use this section to list the project's maintainers and [Trusted Committers](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/p/trusted-committer) (if there are any beyond the maintainers). This is a good place to give credit to Trusted Committers of the project.
  
While it is helpful to share the core team's contact information here, its a best practice to always recommend reaching out via public channels (i.e. Issues, Discussions, or a public channel in Teams).

If your project is conducive to codeowners, link to your `codeowners` file here. Here's more info on codeowners: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

CORE TEAM SECTION GUIDELINES END -->

## Core Team
  
You are more than welcome to reach out to the core team members listed below, but we highly recommend asking questions or proposing ideas within this repo (via [Issues](https://github.com/EsriPS/innersource-template/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/EsriPS/innersource-template/discussions)) so we can keep everything transparent and discoverable!

<!-- ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES START

You made it to the end ðŸŽ‰!

Plenty of projects will find it useful to add more to the README than this template includes, so feel free to add more (don't forget to add them to your TOC!). You can also make use of GitHub's Wiki feature if you need a more in-depth, structured option.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out in MS Teams â€“Â the PS Developers team is a good start, or PS Tech and Delivery > EsriPS GitHub if you have GitHub-specific questions. Feel free to tag Josh Peterson or Gavin Rehkemper in any case.
