## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Issues should be used to report problems with the application, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

In general, we follow the "fork-fix-pull-request" Git workflow as described [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#propose-changes-to-someone-elses-project).

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account.

3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name (e.g. your-initials/feature-you-are-working-on).

4. Commit changes to the branch.

5. Follow any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo.

6. Push changes to your fork

## Submitting a Pull Request

Once you're ready to submit your changes, submit a pull request **into the `main` branch**. We recommend that you open an issue to discuss your proposed changes before making a PR, but you're welcome to submit a PR without an issue so long as you ensure to include a good description of your changes.
